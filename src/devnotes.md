GitHub Issues: https://github.com/trev33b/dice-tooltip2/issues

To Do:
* add tooltip for initiative: .attribute-name.rollable
* add tooltip for .ability-mod.rollable
* add tooltip for .ability-save.rollable
* Create a setting to choose whether you want constant folding turned on (some people might like to see all of the +'s & -'s)
* Add unit test framework (jest?)
* Need to differentiate dice when there's different damage types (like slashing + acid in one set of rolls)
* Add undefined/null guards throughout the code as needed

Mid Term To Do:
* Integrate with Token Action HUD - show tooltips on the actions
* Merge in SW changes from TheSirLancelot

Bugs
* Issue #2 - Console error on spells with saving throws AND damage (formula.replace is not a function)
* Issue #6 - Possible stylesheet conflict with SmallTime module
